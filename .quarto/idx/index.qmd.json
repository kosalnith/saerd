Over centuries, trade, migration, and cultural exchange have left enduring imprints on the region's economic landscape. From the mercantile empires of Srivijaya and Majapahit to the lasting legacies of European colonialism, Southeast Asia has been a crucible of economic experimentation and innovation. In the modern era, rapid industrialization, driven by export-oriented growth strategies and foreign investment, has reshaped the region. The emergence of the Asian Tigers -- Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia -- as economic powerhouses in the last decades of the 20th century, alongside Vietnam's recent rise, underscore the diverse pathways to development, blending state intervention with market mechanisms.\n\nHowever, Southeast Asia's economic journey has been marred by challenges. Persistent inequalities, environmental degradation, and political instability have posed significant obstacles to sustained growth and development.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, understanding the historical evolution of economic thought in the region becomes paramount. Exploring the history of economic thought yields valuable insights into how economic theories and policies have been shaped by cultural, social, and political contexts. By delving into past economic ideas and experiences, decision-makers and academics can gain a deeper understanding of the region's development trajectory, informing contemporary economic policymaking and fostering inclusive, sustainable growth.\n\nWith this background in mind, we, on behalf of the Young Scholars Initiative (YSI), the Cambodia Development Resource Institute (CDRI), and Paññāsāstra University of Cambodia, Siem Reap Campus (PUCSR), extend a warm invitation to PhD scholars and early career researchers for a two-day workshop on economic research and development in Southeast Asia. We welcome submissions focusing on various aspects of the region's economic landscape, including but not limited to the following areas:\n\n-   History of economic thought\n-   Macroeconomics\n-   Energy and environment\n-   Agriculture and sustainability\n-   Governance and public policy\n-   International trade\n-   Labor economics and gender\n\nThe workshop aims to encourage debate and exploration of diverse perspectives on the history of economic thought in Southeast Asia and the corresponding economic policies. Our main goal is to facilitate a thorough comprehension of the role of economic thought in development, fostering international collaboration in academic research and knowledge exchange. Additionally, the workshop offers a platform for both young and senior economists to showcase their work, receive constructive feedback, and establish connections with colleagues investigating similar themes.\n\n## Organizing Committee\n\nKosal Nith (Young Scholars Initiative) <br> Jenny Symaly (Cambodia Development Resource Institute) <br> Sattwick Dey Biswas (Young Scholars Initiative) <br> Sivly Houy (Cambodia Development Resource Institute) <br> Sereyroth Phang (Oxfam Cambodia) <br> Jakkrya Sey (Cambodia Development Resource Institute) <br> Sinoun Hin (Ministry of Post and Communication) <br> Sokhimmarya Chea (Royal University of Law and Economics) <br> Lyhong So (Cambodia Development Resource Institute) <br> Sreymeng Sros (Royal University of Law and Economics) <br> Sophara Phorn (Ministry of Economy and Finance)\n\n## Academic Committee\n\nRebeca Gomez Betancourt (Université Lumière Lyon 2) <br> Fabio Masini (Roma Tre University) <br> Simona Iammarino (The University of Cagliari and London School of Economics and Political Science) <br> Arpan Ganguly (FLAME University) <br> Danilo Spinola (Birmingham City University) <br> Phanith Chou (Royal University of Phnom Penh) <br> Alejandro Márquez-Velázquez (Freie Universität Berlin) <br> Thirunaukarasu Subramaniam (Universiti Malaya) <br> Chandarany Ouch (The United Nations) <br> Chanrith Ngin (Cambodia Development Resource Institute) <br> Daniel Yonto (Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University) <br> Sattwick Dey Biswas (Young Scholars Initiative) <br> Kirirom Cheav (National University of Management) <br> Raymond Leos (American University of Phnom Penh) <br> Sophat Phon (National Bank of Cambodia and Cambodia Econometric Association) <br> Kosal Nith (Young Scholars Initiative)\n\n## Speakers\n\n![Louis-Philippe Rochon, Full Professor of Economics, Laurentian University](images/160223_louisphilippe_rochon.jpg;w=960.jpeg){}\n\n![Sovannroeun Samreth, Professor, Saitama University](images/g9qwZIyJGD.jpeg){width=45%}\n\n![](images/Rani.jpg)\n\n![](images/Phanith-Chou.jpg)\n\n![![](images/Portrait IFC.jpg)](images/dina.jpeg)\n\n![A Lovely Image](mv-1.jpg){group=\"my-gallery\"}\n\n![Another Lovely Image](mv-2.jpg){group=\"my-gallery\"}\n\n![The Last Lovely Image](mv-3.jpg){group=\"my-gallery\"}\n\n## Workshop Program\n\n### DAY 1: Thursday 15 August\n\n#### 08:30 -- 09:00 • Registration\n\nRoom (TBD)\n\n#### **09:00 -- 10:30 • Parallel I**\n\n-   **Session 1A: Political Economy** <br> Room (TBD) <br> Chair: Alexandre Reichart, Renmin University of China\n\n    The Impact of Special Economic Zones on Urbanization Patterns in Cambodia <br> *Daniel Yonto, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University*\n\n    The SOE Landscape in Southeast Asia: Advantages, Challenges, and International Lessons <br> *Jimi Rambo Arranchado, University of Canterbury*\n\n    Smith and Ricardo in Dasgupta: Marginalist Underpinnings <br> *Sai Chikoti, Azim Premji University*\n\n-   **Session 1B: Macroeconomic Policies and Sustainability** <br> Room (TBD) <br> Chair: Sovannroeun Samreth, Saitama University\n\n    Macroeconomic Policy Space and Financing Green Structural Transformation in Southeast Asian Economies <br> *Damon Aitken, SOAS University of London*\n\n    Global Debt Crisis and G20: What is Deliverable? <br> *Shrey Goyal, Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics, United Nations ESCAP*\n\n    US Dollar or KH Dollar?

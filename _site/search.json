    "text": "The economic history of Southeast Asia unfolds as a tale of resilience, adaptation, and transformation. Over centuries, trade, migration, and cultural exchange have left enduring imprints on the region’s economic landscape. From the mercantile empires of Srivijaya and Majapahit to the lasting legacies of European colonialism, Southeast Asia has been a crucible of economic experimentation and innovation. In the modern era, rapid industrialization, driven by export-oriented growth strategies and foreign investment, has reshaped the region. The emergence of the Asian Tigers – Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia – as economic powerhouses in the last decades of the 20th century, alongside Vietnam’s recent rise, underscore the diverse pathways to development, blending state intervention with market mechanisms.\nHowever, Southeast Asia’s economic journey has been marred by challenges. Persistent inequalities, environmental degradation, and political instability have posed significant obstacles to sustained growth and development.\nAgainst this backdrop, understanding the historical evolution of economic thought in the region becomes paramount. Exploring the history of economic thought yields valuable insights into how economic theories and policies have been shaped by cultural, social, and political contexts. By delving into past economic ideas and experiences, decision-makers and academics can gain a deeper understanding of the region’s development trajectory, informing contemporary economic policymaking and fostering inclusive, sustainable growth.\nWith this background in mind, we, on behalf of the Young Scholars Initiative (YSI), the Cambodia Development Resource Institute (CDRI), and Paññāsāstra University of Cambodia, Siem Reap Campus (PUCSR), extend a warm invitation to PhD scholars and early career researchers for a two-day workshop on economic research and development in Southeast Asia. We welcome submissions focusing on various aspects of the region’s economic landscape, including but not limited to the following areas:\n\nHistory of economic thought\nMacroeconomics\nEnergy and environment\nAgriculture and sustainability\nGovernance and public policy\nInternational trade\nLabor economics and gender\n\nThe workshop aims to encourage debate and exploration of diverse perspectives on the history of economic thought in Southeast Asia and the corresponding economic policies. Our main goal is to facilitate a thorough comprehension of the role of economic thought in development, fostering international collaboration in academic research and knowledge exchange. Additionally, the workshop offers a platform for both young and senior economists to showcase their work, receive constructive feedback, and establish connections with colleagues investigating similar themes."

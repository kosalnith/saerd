The economic history of Southeast Asia unfolds as a tale of resilience,
adaptation, and transformation. Over centuries, trade, migration, and
cultural exchange have left enduring imprints on the region's economic
landscape. From the mercantile empires of Srivijaya and Majapahit to the
lasting legacies of European colonialism, Southeast Asia has been a
crucible of economic experimentation and innovation. In the modern era,
rapid industrialization, driven by export-oriented growth strategies and
foreign investment, has reshaped the region. The emergence of the Asian
Tigers -- Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia -- as economic
powerhouses in the last decades of the 20th century, alongside Vietnam's
recent rise, underscore the diverse pathways to development, blending
state intervention with market mechanisms.

However, Southeast Asia's economic journey has been marred by
challenges. Persistent inequalities, environmental degradation, and
political instability have posed significant obstacles to sustained
growth and development.

Against this backdrop, understanding the historical evolution of
economic thought in the region becomes paramount. Exploring the history
of economic thought yields valuable insights into how economic theories
and policies have been shaped by cultural, social, and political
contexts. By delving into past economic ideas and experiences,
decision-makers and academics can gain a deeper understanding of the
region's development trajectory, informing contemporary economic
policymaking and fostering inclusive, sustainable growth.

With this background in mind, we, on behalf of the Young Scholars
Initiative (YSI), the Cambodia Development Resource Institute (CDRI),
and Pa침침캐s캐stra University of Cambodia, Siem Reap Campus (PUCSR), extend
a warm invitation to PhD scholars and early career researchers for a
two-day workshop on economic research and development in Southeast Asia.
We welcome submissions focusing on various aspects of the region's
economic landscape, including but not limited to the following areas:

History of economic thought Macroeconomics Energy and environment
Agriculture and sustainability Governance and public policy
International trade Labor economics and gender
